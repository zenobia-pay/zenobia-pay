# Verified

Never got around to this.

The idea is that the core repo collects product metadata- see statementItems.

That means we know who bought what, and can create public "verified" links that Person A bought XYZ.

Later, can expose that as a service via API to resale services (digital proof of purchase) in exchange for royalties
