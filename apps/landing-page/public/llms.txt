## FAQ

- How does Zenobia Pay work?+


Zenobia Pay works by allowing luxury merchants to accept pay-by-bank.




Our platform uses [ACH](https://www.nacha.org/ach-network) to pull funds out of the customer's account.


These funds are sent to a [beneficiary account](https://www.moderntreasury.com/learn/what-is-an-fbo-account) for the merchant.


We push the funds using [FedNow](https://www.frbservices.org/financial-services/fednow/about.html) with T+2 settlement to your payout account.




Our platform provides instant clearance on ACH bank transfers without merchants having to worry about ACH returns or fraud.


This eliminates credit card processing fees, while providing a seamless checkout experience for high-value transactions.

- Is Zenobia Pay secure?+


Absolutely. Zenobia Pay uses Plaid to connect bank details using OAuth, and refresh tokens are stored in a secure enclave on the device itself.



Zenobia Pay also uses device hardware signing and biometric authentication to ensure that payments are authorized from the same device.



We regularly conduct penetration tests to ensure that your data remains secure. We follow security best practices and encrypt all data at rest and in transit.

- What is Zenobia Pay's fraud guarantee to merchants?+


Customer initiated returns for reasons "account stolen", "transaction not authorized", or "fraud" are covered by Zenobia Pay. Merchants are not liable for these tyypes of fraud or their related ACH-returns.



Fraud guarantee does not cover disputes for the following reasons:




• Item did not arrive


• Item arrived damaged or defective


• Wrong item received (e.g. wrong size, color, or product)


• Item not as described (e.g. materially different from listing/photos)


• Merchandise or service not rendered as promised (e.g. service canceled or incomplete)




Zenobia Pay also works to eliminate friendly fraud. We partner with a small group of high-end merchants, and we know that false chargebacks are a huge problem. Unlike credit card processors who have millions of merchants, we manually review every dispute and promise sane resolution for merchants on Zenobia Pay.

- Does Zenobia Pay have a refund mechanism?+


Yes! Merchants can easily refund customers from the Zenobia Pay dashboard. Customers will receive a refund within 3 days.

## Luxury Payment Solutions
## Zenobia Pay enables luxury brands and jewelers to accept pay-by-bank.    We've built an instant clearing pay-by-bank network with bundled fraud insurance that costs 3 times less in fees than credit card processing.    We are building Zenobia Pay specifically for expensive goods. Items are high intentionality, so we can actually convert customers at checkout. Payments go through your phone without you having to download an app.    Soon, we'll use purchase metadata to provide a digital proof of purchase for the entire lifespan of luxury goods, so that brands can earn verification fees on the $39B resale market, which is growing 3 times faster than new sales.    Zenobia Pay is a branded pay-by-bank rewards network that is the default payment mechanism for all purchases over $200.
