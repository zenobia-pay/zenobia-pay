## 9. Our Use of Cookies and Related Technologies

### Cookies/Local Device Storage

Our services will at times place and/or store code or other types of information and/or software on your device or within your browser, such as cookies, locally shared objects, and HTML5 (collectively, "Local Device Storage"). We and third party service providers may independently or in conjunction use Local Device Storage in connection with the services in a way that collects personal information for the purposes described in our respective privacy policies, including without limitation to determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before on the same or different device and to otherwise control and tailor the display of ads to you based on your perceived preferences, as well as to otherwise administer the services. For example, if you register on any part of the services and are given the option to save your username and password, we may provide this convenience to you via Local Device Storage.

### You May Disable Local Device Storage

If you do not want Local Device Storage, your device, browser, or the settings menu within an application may include an option that allows you to not accept it. However, if you disable Local Device Storage, some portions of the services may not function properly.

### Tracking Technologies

In addition to Local Device Storage, we and/or our third party service providers may use web beacons, web bugs, internet or pixel tags, clear gifs, digital fingerprinting (aka "Machine Identification") and similar technologies (collectively, together with Local Device Storage, the "Tracking Technologies") on the services, including in our communications with you, such as within e-mail and text messages, in-application push notifications, videos, and throughout your use of the services. We and our third party service providers may use Tracking Technologies to determine which messages have been opened by recipients, and for all or some of the same lawful purposes described above for use of Local Device Storage.

### Do Not Track (DNT)

Your browser setting may allow you to automatically transmit a "Do Not Track" (DNT) signal to websites and online services that you visit. There is no consensus as to what DNT means in this context. As a result, like many websites, we do not alter our practices when the services receive a DNT signal from a visitor's browser. To find out more about DNT, please visit http://allaboutdnt.com.

### Global Privacy Control (GPC) and similar privacy preference signals

Where required by applicable local law, we honor user-initiated browser based opt-out preference signals recognized under applicable local law, such as the Global Privacy Control (GPC). To find out more about GPC, please visit https://globalprivacycontrol.org/.

## 10. Data Security

We implement reasonable security measures to protect your personal information. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## 11. Your Rights; Submitting Requests Under Applicable Local Laws

Depending on the jurisdiction in which you live, including if you are a consumer in California, Colorado, Connecticut, or Virginia, you may have the following rights under applicable local law:

To exercise your rights under applicable local law or if you are an authorized agent or parent or guardian seeking to exercise rights on behalf of a minor in accordance with applicable local law (specifically, including California, Colorado, Connecticut, and Virginia) please contact us at privacy@zenobiapay.com.

We reserve the right to take reasonable steps to verify your identify before fulfilling your requests to know, correct, or delete. For example, we may seek to establish your identity to a reasonable or a reasonably high degree of certainty by matching information that you submit alongside your request with information that we have in our records. We may ask you or your authorized agent for supplemental information as needed to establish your identity. Authorized agents may also be required to provide a copy of the consumer's signed permission authorizing the agent to submit requests on the consumer's behalf under applicable local law.

You may have a right to appeal a decision we make relating to requests to exercise your rights under applicable local law. To appeal a decision, please contact us by email at privacy@zenobiapay.com.
