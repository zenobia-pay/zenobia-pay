This standing authorization will remain in full force and effect until you notify Zenobia Pay that you wish to revoke this authorization by contacting us by email at support@zenobiapay.com. You may revoke this standing authorization at any time, however, you must notify Zenobia Pay at least three (3) business days before any EFT payment is scheduled to occur, to prevent the upcoming transaction from processing. Zenobia Pay reserves the right to revoke this standing authorization at any time, for any reason, including but not limited to, any breach of the terms or your failure to comply with federal and/or state laws or the rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association (“NACHA”).

You understand that by providing Zenobia Pay with a Payment Account, you certify that you are an authorized signer on the Payment Account. To make an EFT payment, you understand that you must have the full payment amount available in your Payment Account.

You acknowledge and understand that EFT payments must comply with U.S. law and NACHA rules. If the EFT payment date falls on a weekend or holiday, it will be credited as of the next business day.

If your EFT payment is returned for any reason, including insufficient funds (“NSF”), Zenobia Pay may, at its discretion, attempt to process the entry again up to two (2) times and you authorize Zenobia Pay to initiate any entries to any linked external bank account for any returned ETF, or to correct any errors. You acknowledge that Zenobia Pay and any of its successors, assigns, agents, partners, and/or service providers may assess an additional fee for any EFT that is returned and you further authorize Zenobia Pay to initiate an entry to any linked external bank account if your payment is returned unpaid and you are assessed a fee.
